**** Tests will only work until 1/1/2058! ****

Ideas for future development:
- JQUERY PROJECT - for filter by location in Hunts index view make the city list
 update once you select the state
- make items for hunt appear in order (ie the next one shows only after you find
 the first one)
- fix comments-cannot save comments for active hunt because once a hunt has
started it cannot be updated!
