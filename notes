11/27 to do:
- start working on controllers


4. controllers
    - requires nested resources w/ restful urls
        - nested resource must povide a form that relates to parent resource
5. views
    - requires a nested form w/ a custom attribute writer
    - authentication: standard login and outside service (fb)
        - authentication (use oauth for FB)
    - forms should display validation errors enclosed in class="fields_with_errors" with error messages present in views   --- put devise errors in layouts/application for now!
    - dropdown menu w/ all us states
5.5 features
    - when hunt is active there is a leaderboard on the hunt view page
    - can only join pending hunts
6. check off requirements in spec file
7. write README.md
    - requires one AR scope level method (see the boat lab - https://github.com/lpassamano/model-class-methods-lab-v-000) --- I think this is done, but will need to check!

General notes:
-keep it dry
-separation of concerns (mvc and btwn models)
-use helper methods in views and partials
-record coding session
