- hunt show page:
1. add date and location and meeting place

- css style
1. found items -- .found_items
3. add classes to some buttons to style them??? (join team when on hunt show page, found it!)
5. nav bar

-messages --
go through spec comments re: error messages
add error and success messages for better UX



5.7 add descriptions to hunts???? see what the show page looks like once some styling is added.
5.9 REFACTOR!!!  -- modules for methods that are the same?
    nested attributes for location --- Hunt and User
    add_found_items -- Team and Item
7. write README.md
8. record walk through


GEMS to research
-factory_bot #creates seed data
    http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/factory_bot/file/GETTING_STARTED.md
-database_cleaner #look up how ot use this again
-faker #generates fake data
-friendly_id #slugging and permalink gem


Ideas for future development:
- JQUERY PROJECT - for filter by location in Hunts index view make the city list update once you select the state
- make items for hunt appear in order (ie the next one shows only after you find the first one)
